    <p>Powerbuilding, a relatively new and trendy buzzword in strength training, is continuing to grow in popularity due to the principles that most powerbuilding programs aim to accomplish: (1) get stronger, with periodized compound movements and (2) look better, with specific and curated accessories. 

Powerbuilding programs blend foundational concepts taken from powerlifting and bodybuilding styles of training. This means athletes simultaneously improve their strength through the use of the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press, while also focusing on their body composition with accessories catered to the aesthetics of specific areas on the body.
<br>
Powerbuilding is the combination of powerlifting and bodybuilding styles in one training program. A powerbuilding program will include both high intensity, low rep work for strength, which is used in powerlifting programs, along with low intensity, high rep work for body composition, which is similar to traditional bodybuilding training. 
<br>
The concept of powerbuilding is by no means new, as this style of training has been popular for quite some time across every strength circle. However, powerbuilding style programs are continuing to grow in popularity for two big reasons. 

      
      <ul>
    <li id="Squat">Squat</li>
 <br>
        <p>A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint plantarflexes when standing up.
<br>
Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus. The squat also isometrically uses the erector spinae and the abdominal muscles, among others.
<br><br>
<code>
        <ol>
        <li>Set bar across upper back/traps</li>
        <li>Unrack the bar.</li>
        <li>Take a deep breath and bend both knees and hips at the same time.</li>
        <li>Squat down until your thighs are parallel with the floor.</li>
        <li>Sit back up and rack the bar.</li>
                  </ol>
        </code>
<br><br>
Squats can be performed to varying depths. The competition standard is for the crease of the hip (top surface of the leg at the hip joint) to fall below the top of the knee; this is colloquially known as "parallel" depth. Although it may be confusing, many other definitions for "parallel" depth abound, none of which represents the standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground; the hip joint itself below the top of the knee, or femur parallel to the floor; and the top of the upper thigh (i.e., top of the quadriceps) below the top of the knee. Squatting below parallel qualifies a squat as deep while squatting above it qualifies as shallow. Some authorities caution against deep squats; though the forces on the ACL and PCL decrease at high flexion, compressive forces on the menisci and articular cartilages in the knee peak at these same high angles. This makes the relative safety of deep versus shallow squats difficult to determine.
<br><br>
As the body descends, the hips and knees undergo flexion, the ankle extends (dorsiflexes) and muscles around the joint contract eccentrically, reaching maximal contraction at the bottom of the movement while slowing and reversing descent. The muscles around the hips provide the power out of the bottom. If the knees slide forward or cave in then tension is taken from the hamstrings, hindering power on the ascent. Returning to vertical contracts the muscles concentrically, and the hips and knees undergo extension while the ankle plantarflexes.

Common errors of squat form include descending too rapidly and flexing the torso too far forward. Rapid descent risks being unable to complete the lift or causing injury. This occurs when the descent causes the squatting muscles to relax and tightness at the bottom is lost as a result. Over-flexing the torso greatly increases the forces exerted on the lower back, risking a spinal disc herniation. Another error is when the knee is not aligned with the direction of the toes, entering a valgus position, which can adversely stress the knee joint. Another error is the raising of heels off the floor, which reduces the contribution of the gluteus muscles.

    <li id="Bench">Bench</li>
    <br>
        <p>
          The bench press, or chest press, is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.
<br><br>
The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and squat, and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles. 
<br><br>
          The person performing the exercise lies on their back on a bench with a barbell grasped in both hands. They lower the barbell to chest level, then press the barbell upwards, extending the arms until the elbows are locked out. This is one repetition (rep).
<br><br>
Powerlifting: Take position on a flat bench with body weight resting on buttocks and upper traps having an arched back and feet driven into the floor. Movement requires the weight to be taken at full arms' length, lowered to upper torso, paused, and then lifted to starting position.
        </p>
    <li id="Deadlift">Deadlift</li>
    <br>
        <p>A deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum), such as weights lying on the ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises in which all repetitions begin with dead weight. In most other lifts, there is an eccentric (lowering of the weight) phase followed by the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. During these exercises, a small amount of energy is stored in the stretched muscles and tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is not flexible beyond the range of motion.Although this exercise uses the legs and hips as the primary movers, it can also be considered a back exercise.
<br><br>
There are several positions one can approach when performing the deadlift, which include the conventional deadlift and sumo deadlift.
<br><br>
Setup: When performing a deadlift, a lifter sets in a position that eccentrically loads the gluteus maximus, gluteus minimus, biceps femoris, semitendinosus and semimembranosus while the muscles of the lumbar contract isometrically in an effort to stabilize the spine.
Set behind the bar with it touching or nearly touching the legs.
Begin by hinging at the hips and knees, setting one's weight predominantly in the heels while maintaining flat feet.
Maintain the spine long and straight as the hips hinge back, taking care not to allow the knees to track forwards over the toes.
Grip the bar outside of the legs.
Depress the shoulders away from the ears to load the lats and to generate force throughout the spinal erectors.
<br><br>
Drive: The next section of the deadlift produces the highest amount of force. By pushing down through their heels while simultaneously pushing up and forward with their hips and maintaining a depressed scapula and a long tense spine, an individual can remain safe during this motion. This is considered the most difficult part of the entire movement due to the amount of work required to drive the bar off the ground initially.

Take a deep diaphragmatic breath and hold it in during the movement, creating an outward pressure on the core to further stabilize the lumbopelvic hip complex and core throughout the motion.
Keep the muscles of the back contracted tightly in order to maintain a safe posture throughout the motion. Drive up and forward with the hips and legs to stand erect and lift the bar.
<br><br>
Lockout: The finish is the most critical aspect of the motion. This requires being totally erect with a neutral spine and forceful hip extension to engage the muscles of the lumbar spine and abdomen in unison with the glutes. Drive the hips completely into the bar.
Contract the glutei and the rectus abdominis to finish the movement with the pelvis in a neutral position. Contracting the glutes as well as the abdominal muscles is critical for lower back health and safety.
<br><br>
Lowering the weight: Performing the above steps in reverse order. As the muscles of the back and core must remain tight throughout the motion, one should simply hinge at the hips and knees to bring the weight down. Lowering the chest towards the knees while keeping the bar close is the safest way to complete the motion.

    <li id="OHP">Overhead Press</li>
      <br><p>
        The overhead press (abbreviated OHP), also referred to as a shoulder press, military press, or simply the press, is a weight training exercise with many variations. It is typically performed while either standing or sitting sometimes also when squatting, in which a weight is pressed straight upwards from racking position until the arms are locked out overhead, while the legs, lower back and abs maintain balance. The exercise helps build muscular shoulders with bigger arms, and is one of the most difficult compound upper-body exercises. The world record overhead press was performed by Owhe Bruno in Russia in 1997.
        <br><br>
        The overhead press is set up by taking a barbell or other weight and putting it in a racking position. This can be done by taking the weight from a rack or by cleaning the weight from the floor (clean and press). The weight is then pressed to overhead until the elbows are fully locked out. As the weight clears the head, the lifter leans forward slightly or comes directly under, in order to keep balance. As the weight is lowered back to the racking position and clears the head again, the lifter leans slightly back. The overhead press is a highly effective compound full-body exercise.

The exercise can be done sitting or standing, with alternating arms or with a hammer grip in which the palms face each other. Performing it standing recruits many more muscle groups in order to maintain balance and support the lift, rather than performing it seated. Like the squat and deadlift, it can be thought of as a whole-body exercise, to some extent.
