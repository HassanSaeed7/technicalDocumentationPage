    <h1 id="Intro">Introduction to Powerbuilding</h1>
    <p>Powerbuilding, a relatively new and trendy buzzword in strength training, is continuing to grow in popularity due to the principles that most powerbuilding programs aim to accomplish: (1) get stronger, with periodized compound movements and (2) look better, with specific and curated accessories. 

Powerbuilding programs blend foundational concepts taken from powerlifting and bodybuilding styles of training. This means athletes simultaneously improve their strength through the use of the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press, while also focusing on their body composition with accessories catered to the aesthetics of specific areas on the body.
